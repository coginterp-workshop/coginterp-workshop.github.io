# Formatting Instructions

## Style & Author Instructions

Submissions should be formatted using the [ICLR 2023 latex template and formatting instructions](https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/iclr2023.zip). Papers must be submitted as a PDF file and there will be a strict upper limit of 4 pages for the main text, which should include all main results, figures, and tables. This page limit applies to both the initial and final camera ready version., including all main results, figures, and tables. There is no page limit for the citations, and additional appendices for supplementary details are allowed, but reviewers are not expected to take the appendices into account.

## Camera-Ready Revisions 

Camera-ready revisions will be possible through OpenReview. While the workshop has no official proceedings, we strongly encourage authors to submit a revised "camera-ready" version taking reviewers' comments and suggestions into account. We suggest uploading a revised version prior to the workshop, and possibly another final version (incorporating additional feedback from the poster session and workshop) one week after the workshop.
