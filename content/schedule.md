## Format

The workshop is part of ICLR and as such registration to ICLR is required to attend. 
The workshop will be held virtually. For remote participation, all workshop talks will be live-streamed.

<!-- 
virtual poster sessions will be run on <a href="https://gather.town/app/fdnUf3ZhiXnz0Eub/UAIsland2022">Gather Town</a> in parallel to the in-person ones**. The <a href="https://gather.town/app/fdnUf3ZhiXnz0Eub/UAIsland2022">Gather Town</a> platform will be the same as the one used for the main conference and the other UAI workshops. 
-->

<!-- There will be a single Zoom meeting for the whole day, which is accessible via ICLR 2023’s Zoom Events; if you are registered, you should have received information from the main conference on how to access the Zoom Events Lobby. 
-->


## Poster Session

All accepted papers will be presented in <a href="https://gather.town">Gather Town</a>.

<!--
at the workshop. All posters should be put up in the morning (e.g., during the first break) and will remain up during the whole day (i.e., all posters are presented during both poster sessions). 
-->
<!-- It is allowed and encouraged to present posters both physically and virtually at the same time, e.g., if you have a co-author who will not attend in person and is willing to present online for the virtual participants.
-->
